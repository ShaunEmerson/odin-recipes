# odin-recipes
Build a basic recipe website consisting of a home page and several
recipe pages.

By the end of this project I will have demonstrated my ability create a git repository,
clone that repository onto my computer, and add, commit, and push iterations to git.
I will also demonstrate my ability to build a basic boiler-plate homepage
several secondary pages, and lists of links to other pages.
